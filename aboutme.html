        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h4>
            Hi, my name is Josh McFarlin, and I am a first year Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia.
        </h4>
        <p>
            I have five years of programming experience, primarily focusing in Python,
            but I have been expanding my skills into Java and also mobile and web languages.
            My primary work setup includes PyCharm, IntelliJ, and WebStorm for programming,
            and Git and Github for version control. Expanding on my Python skill is experience
            with the Django and Flask frameworks to create web apps and APIs. I also have experience
            with Ionic framework, as I have created two cross-platform apps. The many projects I have
            worked on have also resulted in experience with different forms of databases such as
            SQLite, MySQL, and Firebase.
        </p>
        <p>
            My true passion in Computer Science lies in blockchain technology,
            and I am currently focusing on becoming a blockchain engineer.
            Blockchain technology is opening new channels for everyday people
            and computers to interact with data and each other like never
            before, and I find it an incredibly interesting and exciting field.
        </p>
        <p>
            While working on front end designs, I focus on creating functional, smooth,
            and beautiful user interfaces to create programs that are simple and fluid.
            I'm a big fan of flat design and minimalism, and I try to create interfaces
            that reflect these principles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am actively seeking internships and projects to work on, if you are interested by my work,
            feel free to <a href="./contactme.html">contact me</a>.
